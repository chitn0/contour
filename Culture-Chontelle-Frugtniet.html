    <p>Japanese-born Australian artist Hiromi Tango’s career excelled when their exhibition, “Promised,” was held at Sydney’s Sullivan+Strumpf gallery back in 2014. It was her intensive practice since then that has gained her an international audience. Drawing on her interest in the therapeutic power of art, Hiromi creates large-scale, sculptural installations that resemble wild, living, organic masses, rawness of emotion, memory, and experience through colour.</p>
      <p>The term Art Magic has been used by Tango to describe her works. The term has gone global in the last 18 months, but it was a struggle to understand what she meant by it. In her recent interview with Ocla Magazine July edition, though, she breaks down the definition, stating: “Bringing together purposeful art techniques are known to improve and preserve certain types of brain function with the benefits of social connectedness when people come together”. This year she has become one of the top 12 artists by Blouin Art for her recent work fluorescence.</p>
    <p>The artists process has no beginning and no end. According to Aesthetics Magazine, Tango explains that her structures “grow,and cut, and fly and connect” .Her immersive installations use vibrant colours and objects which forms a part of a story. Using donated objects, she constantly recycles her old art and cohorts them into previous works which then grows into new pieces that traces the interactions of ensuing recognition to the affective core in her art. Fluorescence is a constructed piece using woven and perspex textiles that are finely intertwined to form elements that encapsulated universal expression to the unified experience.</p>
    <p>The exhibition presents new works by the artist which is an attempt to connect with her estranged father by exploring the way in which bright colours and lights affect brain function. With her father’s declining health and diagnosis of Dementia, Tango creates a body of mixed-media sculptures that aims to bring her father a sense of comfort and joy, coming from a sentimental place. According to Ocla Magazine, she says, “My father has been bedridden for a few years, but particularly in the last few months. His hearing, eyesight, and memory – his brain and bodily function have deteriorated quite dramatically. I made series of artworks based on the memory of my father and the evolving relationship with him: our similarities, a remembrance between us.” She explains further:</p> 
    <p>“On a personal level, the works are a way of connecting the segment of memory about my father that at one time I deliberately lost. Now I am re-gathering the essence of him, of what I remember of him, and trying to understand something very important – although I don’t yet know what it is.” When reviewing Tango’s work, I was deeply moved.  She had me exploring the ideas into one’s mind, body and spirit through intergenerational relationships.</p> 
      <p>Her performative installations are a combination of cultural connections and interactivity to one’s individuality on experiences. Most importantly, the combination of woven materials with words made for a beautiful sight.  Just the word “tears” surrounded by beautiful construction embarks a new meaning to expressing loss.</p>
    <p>Tango’s fascination with neuroscience has opened doors to thinking through light as a medical tool and the illumination of brain structures. She is interested in reclaiming a space for uncertainty — opening up the cracks between scientific data in order to investigate something more sensory and emotional as she reinvents contemporary and cultural art.</p>
