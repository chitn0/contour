      <p>It’s easy to imagine the world as being a colossal place and humans as minuscule as the size of ants however it isn’t until you go off exploring and travelling that you really get a feel for just how vast and immeasurable our world and the many cultures within it really is. Our planet is so incredible that not everything it has to offer can be seen by the naked eye. So what we are able to see is the reason why travelling and exploring our world is one of the greatest experiences anyone of any age could ever endure.</p>
    <p>Travelling isn’t limited to jetting off to the furthest place from your origin; rather travelling could be a 6-hour drive up the coast or a 22-hour flight to London. Travelling comes with excitement and for some it also brings worry. Could it be the constant reminder that you are thousands of miles above sea level, floating 
in the air? Even for those without fear, there is always a sense of unknown for the duration of a flight. Or is it the worry that comes with being so far away from the 
norm and what you are most comfortable with?</p>

    <p>Luckily travellers in recent years have been fortunate enough to try out the new Airbus A380’s, myself included, and if there’s one way to make a plane flight a little more enjoyable, it’s legroom. Aircraft engineers have finally created the one thing everyone is searching for more of on any flight to any destination in the world.</p>
      <p>Sometimes people say that travel can change a person and it wasn’t until I explored Dubai and Europe for 7 weeks that I realised that this isn’t just a saying... it’s real. You can hear from friends and family that the places on your sightseeing list will be unlike anything you have ever experienced before but it isn’t until you are there in the moment standing at the foot of the 828m, sky high Burj Khalifa in Dubai or at the top of the 324m Eiffel Tower in Paris, that you realise just how lucky you are to travel.</p>

    <p>Travel allows the mind to experience different emotions, it allows our senses to be infused in different cultures and it can teach us to be selfless. The ancient Greek Poet Euripides once suggested, “Experience, travel – these are as education in themselves”. If you’re searching for history or if you’re searching for relaxation, Europe can offer you both extremes.</p>
    <p>Standing in the middle of the Arabian Desert is an experience I will never forget. Being thrown into such a diverse culture is one thing but to be absolutely mind blown by a city that I came to with no preconceived idea is why I will forever speak highly of Dubai. Many of us in Australia associate the Middle East with poverty and armed conflict, however to learn firsthand that Dubai is the second richest city, second only to Abu Dhabi, makes you realise a lot of the places you may have never heard of or explored before can offer you a chance to open your mind and be less judgmental about the perceptions created by the western world.</p>

      <p>When it comes to history I certainly didn’t expect to spend 3 hours on guided tours around the Vatican City and the Colosseum and end up loving them. The Vatican and Colosseum holds incomprehensible amounts of history however, unlike a brochure, it takes a special kind of tour guide to really hold your interest. Luckily for myself, my family and the other 8 people in our group, it made our tour one of the most enjoyable history lessons I have ever endured. Did you know that the Vatican City is actually a country smaller than the size of New York’s Central Park? No brochure would ever tell you that. The Huffington Post accurately states that “walking streets that were walked hundreds of years ago, standing in buildings that stood during ancient times – gives you a rich, unparalleled understanding of the past”. Simone a 32-year-old archaeologist born and raised in Rome has been providing guided tours for tourists around the Vatican and the Colosseum for 8 years. His background in archaeology along with a PHD in Ancient history and his thoroughly humorous ways proved to be the best combination that left me wanting to know more and more about these fascinating landmarks.</p>

     <p>The incredibly aged architecture situated in the heart of Venice and the many quaint stores hidden within the tiniest of walkways brings a compelling contentment and sense of ease whilst you forgot about all of the responsibilities you have back home. The gondola rides and the many hundreds of excited tourists like myself bring to life the love of this place shared by millions around the world.</p>
     <p>If you’re into discovering places you never thought possible then the impeccable glaciers situated within Chamonix in the French Alps is the way to go. Entering a world of -3 degrees whilst dressed in summer attire seemed a little crazy until I started exploring the ice carvings within one of the world’s greatest glaciers that I suddenly forgot how numb my body had become. The water droplets falling from within the glacier seemed all too familiar as I stood on the Eiffel Tower in the pouring rain. Being within a city such a Paris, a little water couldn’t dampen the magic and authenticity a place like this exhorts.</p>
     <p class="quote">Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.</p>
    <p>If you’re looking to relax don’t go past Croatia. Along with all its hidden treasures, secluded beaches and hidden bars amongst the lush dense forest provided me with the ultimate week of relaxation. The immaculate waters offered a distraction from the discomfort felt beneath my feet as I crossed the large pebbles that act as a substitute for sand. Europe will help any Australian to appreciate our exquisite sandy beaches just that little bit more. So if you plan on visiting Europe make sure you pack a pair of water shoes, trust me, they will become your best friend whenever you are seaside.</p>
    <p>You might spend thousands of dollars on a European getaway however an unknown source accurately put into perspective that “travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer”. Unfortunately with travel, come expectations. Wes Siler explains the easiest way to travel is to just “go with the flow of the new country and experience this new culture on its own terms”. With a mentality such as this, an open mind, a passport and a camera you’ll be sure to come home a changed person.</p>
