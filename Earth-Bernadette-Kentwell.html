    <p class="quote">"I love the people and the style. That’s what makes Newtown that little bit more special... This whole process of rediscovering art has changed me a lot. It expands the world..."<span class="author"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans of Newtown</i></span></p>
      <p class="quote">"Newtown is quite busy and the restaurants are full... We must have walked past at least 20 Thai restaurants before deciding on Newtown Thai based on a friend’s recommendation. The restaurant is nice and small, busy and inviting."<span class="author"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Excuse Me Waiter</i></span></p>
    <p>Newtown is a place known for its bohemian culture. The streets are alive, they have spirit and personality brought to you by language through cultural cuisine and art in the literal and creative sense. Newtown is one of my favourites places to go, for it’s relaxing and carefree lifestyle where there are no limits. No matter what time of the day you go, there is always something for you to do, something to enjoy and something new to experience. Newtown is a place for everyone!</p>
    
    <p>To me, Newtown is a home away from home. Culturally speaking, there are a wide range of cultures that can be experienced in Newtown through cuisine. Thai food in Newtown is a major hit. I absolutely love Thai food and my favourite Thai place to go is Thai Newtown, here where you can find great tasting meals filled with a great aroma for a reasonable price. One thing I’ve noticed about the Thai restaurants in Newtown, is that no matter where you go you always feel like you’ve been given an authentic experience both through food and experience.</p>
    <p>Although Thai is one of my favourite cuisines, I have found that my favourite restaurant in Newtown is the Italian restaurant called Twelve.  The look and feel of this restaurant is very industrial which is one of the main reasons I love it. The staff are more often than not of an Italian background, which gives the restaurant a more authentic feel. The food is always cooked with passion and is full of flavour, I find that no matter what I pick off the menu I can never go wrong and I haven’t been disappointed yet! I find some Italian restaurants can be pretty average with their meals, as there is very little range to choose from on their menu. This is not the case at Twelve.</p>
    <p>Along with Thai and Italian, other cuisines you can indulge yourself in include Sushi at the Newtown ‘Sushi Train’, Burritos at ‘Guzman y Gomes’, burgers at ‘Burger fuel’, Indian at ‘Tamana’s Indian Diner’ and if you are a vegan there is ‘Sadhana Kitchen’ for you. When dinner is done, Max Brenner is the next place to visit. Great chocolate fix to satisfy your sweet tooth, a great place to just hang out and I’m sure I’m not the only one to say that Max Brenner is just an overall great place to go.</p>

    <p>Newtown is well known for its artful culture. Art within Newtown has the ability to convey meaning and expression. Art in Newtown is mainly used to express creativity and to inspire, although it can also be used in a way of power to promote common concern and issues. No matter where you turn in Newtown I find there is art everywhere, which is amazing. The idea of graffiti is used in a creative sense to either create murals, inspire people or to just add a bit of colour to the streets.</p>
    <p>While walking through Newtown I notice that the majority of building’s on corners, their side walls were nothing but colourful with either stencil art, tags, murals, pictures or quote’s.One of Newtown’s most iconic murals is the “I have a dream” quote written upon one of the buildings in Newtown. This quote represents the vibe and culture of Newtown demonstrating how the community encourage and support everyone in their hopes and dreams and how they won’t judge based on beliefs. This mural shows just how art can be used to inspire and support the community without having to directly interact with them.</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"This whole process of rediscovering art has changed me a lot. It’s shown me possibilities and it’s helped me to connect with a whole bunch of people that I wouldn’t have before. It expands the world and it makes me much more empathetic for people. I’m now more patient and humble in how I try and understand them."<span class="author"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oscar Finch</i></span></p>
    <p>Art is quite powerful in every sense, people can find peace and harmony through tones and the contoured lines which can put some peoples minds at ease. I personally love how art affects everyone differently and how people see Newtown as a blank canvas where they feel free to express themselves. Newtown is where you can experience culture and language through food, experience and art. I love Newtown for its ability to create an atmosphere that no other places has the ability to match. The multicultural aspect of culture, the freeness of creativity, the welcoming atmosphere, the ability to just go and have a good time without judgment are the main reasons why I chose Newtown over a night out to the city or a small brunch at my local suburb. Newtown should be on your list of places to visit, just to say you’ve experienced the unique culture it has to offer.</p>
