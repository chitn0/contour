      <h3>The Food Revolution Theory</h3>
        <p class="subheading">Exploring the reasons behind this generation’s food obsession</p>
        
        <img class="test"alt="" src="img/_earth/Gillian/Gillian-1.jpg">
        <p class="quote">"Food is our common ground, a universal experience."<span class="author"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;James Beard</i></span></p>
        
        <p>Over the first two decades of the 21st Century, our screens have been bombarded with images of food, eating, cooking, and we have become an era obsessed with the addiction of having to document everything we eat. Food has become omnipresent across all platforms and all media.</p>
        <p>Scroll through Instagram and there will be photos of what your friend ate for brunch at this café in Newtown or check your Snapchat for videos of people making breakfast. Grab a magazine or newspaper and you’ll find restaurant reviews on the newest burger joint in Sydney. Go online and there will be a score of food bloggers or YouTube vloggers (video bloggers) with a whole list of food challenges. “MasterChef” or “My Kitchen Rules”, we’ve all seen at least one of these shows at least once when we turn the TV on. Renowned chefs and food critics are gathered around a table ready to eliminate a contestant because “the Beef Carpaccio’s chilly maroon flesh was not charred enough”. What a turn-around this has become from the last century where chefs were behind the scenes slaving away in grey stainless-steel kitchens.</p>

        <img class="" alt="" src="img/_earth/Gillian/Gillian-2.jpg">
        
        <p>What has happened to us in recent years that has led to this transformation into rock star celebrity chefs and food critics? And what about other nations? What would a man or woman in a third-world country be taking a food photo of today? Have we become too focused on what we can take from the food of other countries rather than focusing on what we can give in return? We are over-consuming and over the top. With our crazy donut-waffle-jellybean-chicken-wing-topped-milkshakes and burgers the size of cakes; When do we draw the line?</p>
        <p>Food has had such a huge influence on impacting our lives and the way we live and interact. Have you ever noticed how angry you become when you’re hungry? Well we’ve invented a new word for it; Hangry. And how extremely happy are you after you’ve eaten a great meal? There’s nothing that can bring you comfort like comfort food. It’s crazy how food can impact our thoughts, feelings and emotions. Besides all the craziness over food, it does seem to posses the ability to bring us together.</p>

        <img class="" alt="" src="img/_earth/Gillian/Gillian-3.jpg">

        <p>So it’s a special occasion, your mum’s birthday perhaps – the first thing that comes to mind is “Let’s have dinner!” or “What food should we have at the party?” We think of the best restaurants to take our favourite people. We think of romantic candle-lit dinners. One of the worst dates I’ve been on was when I rocked up and asked “So where are we going to eat?” to which my date replied, “I already ate.” There’s not really a mystery as to how that date ended.</p>
        <p>Think about cooking in the kitchen with grandma when you were seven or gathering at the dinner table when all the food was ready (probably with Masterchef on the TV while you ate and predicted who was going to have the best dish). In class or at work we share our food with peers and get this sense of being “cultured” by experiencing something new, tasting something weird and wondering and rare. Food brings people together. In Australia we have the food of the world at our table, naturally sourced from the best local produce. When you give ome of the best chef’s in the world all of Australia’s freshest ingredients you get some of the best food in the world right here. Almost everywhere in Sydney has a diversity of restaurants of different cuisines. We connect even on a global scale, attracting and adapting food cultures from many other nations. In Italian culture for instance, no one (or very rarely) eats pasta alone. You are always eating and sharing with someone. Food is meant to be made, shared, celebrated. And I guess that’s why when people can’t share their food physically, they share it digitally.</p>
