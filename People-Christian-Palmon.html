      <h4>DOCTOR AGNODICE</h4>
        <p class="quote">"To help people live healthier, more active lives by providing
the data, inspiration and guidance to reach their goals."<span class="author"><i></i></span></p>
 <img alt="" src="img/_People/Christian/Christian-1.jpg" >
    <p>A rather controversial figure in history not just because of her risky life, but whether she’s actually real. Presenting to you one of the first ever recorded female doctors in history, the Athenian Agnodice. Mythical theories aside, Agnodice lived during the 1st century in Ancient Greece, pursuing a career in medicine in the masquerade of a man. Think Mulan, but with less war and more child birthing, in fact, Doctor Agnodice was a specialist in women’s health, being most recognisable for aiding expecting mothers and sick wives.</p>
        <p>Just like Mulan, a lot of men did not like Agnodice: male medical practitioners grew jealous of her work, accusing Agnodice of seducing their wives.This reaction was expected though, because records show that Agnodice was known for her attractive androgynous features, which were popular during that time period. Because of her good looks and even greater skills, Agnodice being close to a lot women that preferred her advice over their doctor husbands was suspicious enough to warrant a trial. <br>When brought to court, the doctor revealed herself literally and metaphorically; removing her clothes and giving her rivals a verbal smack down with their wives in full support of Agnodice’s actions.</p>
        <p>No one questioned her ever again, and she’s been an inspirational icon ever since.</p>
        <h4>SAMURAI YASUKE</h4>
        <p class="quote">"Sounds awfully like a Hollywood blockbuster, but no, he’s real."<span class="author"><i></i></span></p> 
        <img alt="" src="img/_People/Christian/Christian-2.jpg" >
        <p>When you think of samurais you think of Japanese men with those katana swords, right? Yasuke was a 6ft tall warrior of African descent who escaped slavery. Sounds awfully like a Hollywood blockbuster, but no, he’s real.</p>
        <p>Yasuke was an African slave purchased by a missionary to aid in spreading Christianity to 16th century Japan.</p>
        <p>Thanks to his eye catching physique, the Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga purchased Yasuke as a servant, freeing the ex-slave and branding him as a respected soon to be warrior.<br>Adopting his Japanese name, “Yasuke”, the samurai spent his remaining years as a skilled bodyguard, soldier, mercenary, and eventual samurai: katana and everything.</p>
        <p>All of this, however, was achieved in only a short span of Yasuke’s life. After the Nobunaga family fell during combat, Yasuke was sent to a Jesuit church in Tokyo, presumably to continue his missionary work.</p>
        <p>Not much is known about Yasuke’s history after his samurai career came to an end, but his story has sparked a strong pop cultural bond and appreciation between geeks of the black and Japanese community to this day.</p>
        <h4>GRACE MURRAY HOPPER</h4>
        <p class="quote">"It was her efforts of wanting 'personal computers' sparking a mass production of affordable small pcs for home use."</p> 
        <img alt="" src="img/_People/Christian/Christian-3.jpg" >
        <p>Finally, of course, moving up to more modern times, is the mother of motherboards, Grace Murray Hopper, AKA, Amazing Grace.</p>
        <p>Born in December 9th, 1906, Ms Hopper sailed the ranks of her navy, swept through seas of code, and eventually departed this digital world on January 1st, 1992. Now, Ms Hopper wasn’t just a high ranking naval officer, but she also did code - a lot of it. Known for creating the first language compiler and technical terms such as “debugging”, Grace Murray Hopper sparked a great head start for the future of computers. No really, she removed a pesky moth from her computer to fix it, hence the term “debugging”.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Miss Hopper’s efforts with the previously mentioned compiler, many of our programs would never have existed, and it was her efforts of wanting “personal computers” sparking a mass production of affordable small pcs for home use.Three amazing people, three amazing histories, and three amazing truths you were never told in school. History is always cooler when it’s outside the books.</p>
