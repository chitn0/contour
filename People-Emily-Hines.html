        What could be cooler than spending Halloween dressed up as a half-dead zombie, trolling around Sydney’s George Street and Hyde Park? The event is free, but there are makeup and costume stalls at the park whose proceeds go towards The Brain Foundation. Zombie participants are also encouraged to rally up sponsors for their walk! The Brain Foundation is a nationally registered charity established in 1970 by neurologists and neurosurgeons funding groundbreaking research into neurological disorders, brain disease and brain injuries. <a href="http://www.sydneyzombiewalk.com" target="_blank"><b>www.sydneyzombiewalk.com</b></a>
      <p class="subheading">STEPTEMBER</p>
      <p>Choose your team, register online, receive your free pedometers and you’re set to step, skip, jump! This event involves teams of four rallying together to walk, surf, swim or even dance their way to the daily goal of ten thousand steps. Every dollar raised goes towards providing vital equipment and therapy for children and adults living with cerebral palsy. Alternatively teams can choose to donate their funds towards research into the prevention and cure for cerebral palsy. <a href="http://www.steptember.org.au" target="_blank"><b>www.steptember.org.au</b></a>
       <p class="subheading">SIGNATURE  HIGH TEA</p>
       <p>The McGrath Foundation High Tea is continuing after ten years of success, celebrating what they refer to as, a pink decade. The event gathers people together to enjoy an afternoon of conversation, sweet treats, wine, coffee and, of course, tea! Tickets are $95 per person or $900 for a table, and include all food and drinks throughout the event.All proceeds raises will go to the McGrath Foundation, which funds the care provided by nurses to those suffering and recovering from breast cancer. <a href="http://www.mcgrathfoundation.com.au" target="_blank"><b>www.mcgrathfoundation.com.au</b></a></p>
       <p><img class="flowleft" alt="" src="img/_People/Emily/Emily-2.jpg" style="width:400px"><p class="subheading">ILLAWARA’S TOP  MODEL </p>Earn yourself a modeling career while raising funds to help those living with mental health! While the two aspects seem bizarre together, this event provides a unique opportunity for those with a passion for modeling to step into the spotlight and support a great cause. The winning contestant will get a modeling contract with a European agency, along with a paid trip to Europe. The catch is that all entrants must gather up enough community support to raise $500, all of which goes to the Light and Hope Mental Health Clubhouse. This organisation aims to bring mental health issues out of the shadows in order to help sufferers begin to build a stronger, brighter future. <a href="http://www.highlightsonmentalhealth.org.au" target="_blank"><b>www.highlightsonmentalhealth.org.au</b></a></p> 
        <p class="subheading">BARROWTHON</p> 
       <p>The Beechworth to Mt Buffalo Barrowthon has been running since 1935! The event itself instead each participating team of four to ten people can choose an organisation that they want to raise funds for. What is impressive about this event is not only its life span of success, but what it involves. Teams embark on a marathon wheelbarrow race, from Beechworth all the way to Mt Buffalo. People or companies can sponsor teams, which creates a fun opportunity to do up the barrows, kind of like race cars! <a href="http://www.mycause.com.au/events/beechworthbarrowthon54"><b>www.mycause.com.au/events/beechworthbarrowthon54</b></a></p>
      <p class="subheading">MELANOMAWA ZUMBATHON</p>
      <p>This event involves an eight-hour Zumba challenge, where sponsorship funds go towards raising awareness and support for melanoma within the Western Australian community. It doesn’t matter how good or bad you are, the cause makes it all worth it so ‘shake it till you make it’! <a  href="http://www.mycause.com.au/events/zumbathon" target="_blank"><b>www.mycause.com.au/events/zumbathon</b></a></p>

This event, founded by Michelle McClurg, gives people the chance to join a group walk to raise awareness and much needed funding for homeless, abandoned and injured dogs. The one-hour walk costs $35 to join, as well as any extra funds participants can raise. Plus the dogs get free bandanas!  All profits raised on the day go to the Lort Smith Animal Hospital. The hospital is the largest not-for-profit animal hospital within Australia. It includes the medical sector, providing vital care to abandoned and injured pets, shelter, adoption and fostering services to help find these animals a safe and loving and most importantly permanent new home. This event aims to not only raise much-needed funds, but to create awareness about responsible dog ownership. <a href="http://www.mycause.com.au/events/pawsforacaus" target="_blank"><b>mycause.com.au/events/pawsforacaus</b></a></p>
      <p class="subheading">ART AUCTION FOR CHARITY</p>
      <p>Project5’s Art Auction for Charity is a three-day, live painting event. Four artists get together and create artworks as a live show for the public.

      <p class="subheading">SIDETEMBER</p>
      <p>According to the Sidetember organisation, 1 in 12 Australians suffer from a brain injury, however there is little public awareness of the effects of living with these conditions. Throughout September registered participants take part in different daily challenges that are associated with brain injuries, such as not talking for an hour, or using your least dominant hand for part of the day. These tasks aim to help people begin to understand the difficulty of living with brain damage. The aim of this event is to not only raise awareness but participants are encouraged to gather sponsors and donate money to Sidetember, which is given to Brain Injury Organisations across Australia. <a href="http://www.sidetember.com" target="_blank"><b>www.sidetember.com</b></a></p>
