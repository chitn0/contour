      <h3>Different Rules</h3>
      
      <p class="subheading">Will Jarryd Hayne survive in the highly competitive NFL or is he just throwing away what is left of his NRL career?</p>
      <p>Jarryd Hayne was a star in the Australian Rugby league and was about to sign the largest contract in National Rugby League history when he decided to work out for NFL teams. In 2009, Jarryd Hayne was awarded the International Player of the year, which meant he was arguably the best rugby player in the world. The ex-rugby league star was very close to signing a three-year deal worth 6million Australian dollars when he put it all on hold to pursue his dreams of playing in the NFL that has somewhat different rules compared to that of the Rugby League.</p>
      <p>The 28 year old gave up his multi-million dollar contract and moved to the United States to play a game he has never played in his life.  He gave up his high status in the Rugby League to fight for a spot on the 49ers’ training camp roster. Hayne said there were people who offered him more money to stay in Australia and continue his career as a rugby star but he declined all those offers and told them</p>
      <p><b>"That wasn’t the issue, I had a burning desire to want to test myself, mentally and emotionally. The way to do that was in the NFL."</b></p>
      <p>Hayne went on to make other comments as to why he made such an unusual decision when he had a multi-million dollar contract in his grasp. In his comments, he made it clear that his decision is not money driven and that he had always want to test himself as an athlete and at his current age, it’s now or never.</p>

      <p class="quote">The way society is these days, we’re very money-driven. That’s not my mindset. The only time I was money-driven is when I was poor, and I stopped being poor when I was 19 or 20. From then, I’ve just been having fun and wanting to test myself as an athlete.<span class="author"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jarryd Hayne</i></span></p>
      <p>Hayne signed with the San Francisco 49ers in March and has been fighting for a spot in the 53-man roster for the commencement of the NFL season in September. Hayne plays the position of a running back and a kick returner for the 49ers. His debut performance for the San Francisco 49ers on the weekend against the Houston Texans won him a lot of praise globally. Hayne made a two-yard gain with his first touch of the ball and a remarkable 53-yard run with his second touch that ultimately led to a touchdown a few plays later.  Hayne’s 53-yard run was the longest rushing effort in the preseason game. After the game, Hayne said</p>
      <p><b>"I was really excited and it was big too because we ran a play like that a couple of days before and the coach was on to me just to keep in the crease and to let it open up."</b></p>
      <p>His unexpectedly great debut performance has earned him a lot of respect from his teammates, coach and even some well-respected writers. Peter King, one of the game’s most respected writers described Hayne’s performance against the Houston Texans as “really something to see”. In the Sports Illustrated Monday Morning Quarterback column, Peter King called Jarryd Hayne’s 53-yard run against the Houston Texans his play of the weekend. King wrote</p>
      <p><b>"Amazing story out of the Niners-Texans game, In his first American football game - after a career as a star rugby player in Australia, the 28-year-old Hayne bounced outside, separated physically from a couple of tacklers, and bounded up the left side of the Houston defense for a 53-yard run. It was really something to see."</b></p>
      <p>Despite Peter King’s praise of the former Rugby League star, he made sure not to go overboard. He said “pump the brakes on Hayne making the team” and reminded the readers that Hayne’s returning of punts and kicks was his best chance of making the cut.</p>

      <p class="quote">&nbsp;</span>It felt a huge weight lifted. I brought a lot of pressure on myself, I wanted to fit in ... I wanted to go out there and look like an American NFL player and I feel like I did that.<span class="author"><i>Jarryd Hayne</i></span>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick, the star quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers’ thinks that Hayne made a very strong statement with his debut performance and even though it’s not his decision to include the jformer Rugby league star in the 53-man roster, he strongly believes that he made a strong statement in his debut performance. Colin Kaepernick had some words of praise for the former Rugby League star after his astounding debut performance. He said</p>
      <p><b>"He went out there and played really well. He played fast, had a great run and had a couple of good punt returns, so I think everyone is impressed with what he’s done."</b></p>
      <p>While Hayne’s massive run shocked people all over the globe, Kaepernick said he had watched a few of Hayne’s NRL highlights and was looking forward to seeing him do very well as the season progressed but Kaepernick said he was very surprised as he watch him perform and adjust to the new rulesso easily.</p>
      <p>After the game, the San Francisco 49ers coach, Jim Tomsula agreed that the former Rugby league star is adjusting very smoothly to the game which is very new to him and that he did some good things but it’s only the first pre-season game and being a professional athlete, Hayne has a lot more heights to rise reach.</p>

      <p>Lastly, John Madden, the man who unconsciously inspired Jarryd Hayne’s NFL journey had some good things to say about the former Rugby League star and thinks that Hayne is close to securing a spot on the 49ers’ 53-man roster. John Madden, the man whose name graces the “EA Sports ‘MADDEN’ NFL” game, a very well respected Super Bowl winner and now a Hall of Fame-inducted coach said “He doesn’t have as far to go as maybe people think he does. I was surprised at how natural he looked at everything he did.</p>
      <p class="quote">If he could be a punt returner and a kick-off returner, play a few other special teams, that would be an easy situation to get a job with.<span class="author"><i></i></span></p><!--Use a different quote style-->
      <p>Will Jarryd Hayne in the NFL this regular season? Will he reach his goal? Will Hayne be wearing the NO.38 jersey on the 53-man roster?The cynics will say it will never happen and I am very sure they were very loud about it until just before his astounding pre-season debut. We will leave these questions unanswered until when the season begins for the San Francisco 49ers on the 14th September. Until then, Jarryd Hayne still has a lot to prove.</p>
