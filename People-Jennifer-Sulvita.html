      <h3>Ease the Stress</h3>
      <p class="flowright"><img alt="" src="img/_People/Jennifer/Jennifer-1.jpg" style="width:410px;"></p>
      <p>In this day and age, technology has become one of the major factors contributing towards distractions that account to stress. Communicative technologies not only facilitate but also hinder our work productivity and efficiency. They enable us to spend more leisure time than previous generations by providing access to the Internet, information (static and dynamic content) and software application.</p>
      <p>What’s troubling is that surfing the web or accessing software applications is at our fingertips. There is a high tendency for us to use these applications on computers and handheld devices when opportunities arise. We fall into traps, such as reading the latest news, updating a Facebook status, Instagraming a picture or shopping for the latest trends online. Sometimes we are negligent that distraction and procrastination happen without a train of thought. When we do delay set tasks and continue to immerse ourselves in hobbies on these technologies, we are then caught up in the negative effects of stress.</p>

      <p class="flowrighta large-5 medium-12 small-12 quote">Stress is the feeling of being overloaded, wound up tight, tense and worried.<span class="author"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Australian Psychological Society</i></span></p>



      <p>All of us at some stage experience stress. The level of stress we get and how often it occurs varies for each person. Other stressors, besides communicative technologies, include issues relating to work, studies and relationships. I know that many of us can recall various stressful situations that have happened in the past, for instance, sitting for an upcoming exam. Does this sound familiar? At least a month before, we receive our exam timetable. Knowing that it is a few weeks away, we constantly remind ourselves that we need to study but leave it until a week before. Yes, for some of us, the tendency to  neglect our priorities and waste precious study time happens frequently. We continuously tell ourselves “stop the procrastination, let’s focus on studying!” Yet here we are, still fully immersed in our favourite TV show, browsing YouTube and checking our Facebook newsfeeds. We may also be multi-tasking betweenwork priorities. Sooner or later, we begin regretting our bad decisions and start to experience the negative impacts of stress kicking in.</p>
      <p>While most of us think that stress can negatively impact our daily lives, for some, they may not realise that it can also be beneficial. Stress, according to the Australian Psychological Society,  is defined as the ‘feeling of being overloaded, wound up tight, tense and worried’. A healthy amount of stress can improve our focus, which boosts up our performance in areas such as tertiary exams and sporting activities. Positive stress stimulates our motivation and determination to perform well. It keeps us from becoming sluggish and indifferent towards work. We need motivation and determination to achieve our goals and objectives within set constraints, which are our priorities. When we do achieve these goals and objectives, we feel proud of our successes. We are then able to reward ourselves because of the dedication, time and effort we have put in.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the negative impacts of stress can affect us physically, mentally and emotionally. It may result to the irritable point of venting our frustration on others, which can anguish a friend or work colleague. At night we may experience insomnia, which leads to poor concentration and fatigue. Even our immune system can weaken which makes us more susceptible to illness. Eating habits can change from eating proper-portioned sized meals to several meals a day. Instead of eating regular nutritious foods we turn to quick and easy accessible junk foods, which have low nutritional values and keep you full for a short period of time. Suddenly we turn to overeating to fill this void, which can cause health problems and weight gain.</p>

        <p class="subheadingtwo">Ways of Managing Stress</p>
        <p>So how should we manage stress? How do we ensure that distractions, particularly communicative technologies - computers, TV and portable devices - have little to no interference with assigned tasks and duties? There are a number of ways of dealing and managing stress. I am sure that many of us are familiar with at least two of the following methods.</p>
        <h5>Identifying early warning signs</h5>
        <p>We need to identify the early warning signs of stress. These warning signs in our body vary from one person to another. Our body may show signs of tensing our jaw, grinding our teeth, getting headaches or feeling irritable and short tempered.</p>
        <h5>Identifying the stressors</h5>
        <p>Identifying stressors helps us to understand our problems. After we identify the stressors, we can then findways to work around them. In the context of communication technologies, stressors include extensive hours of watching television, having movie marathons and feeling hungry and lethargic due to skipping meals.</p>
        <h5>Creating routines and sticking to them</h5>
        <p>It is essential to create routines as they reassure and calm us. We can set regular times for exercise and relaxation such as jogging around the neighbourhood or Pilates. Having regular meal times, waking and bedtimes ensures a steady sleeping and eating pattern. Planning in advance to do certain jobs on set days of the week enables us to carry out manageable workloads.</p>
        <h5>Spending time with people who care about us</h5>
        <p>Spending time with people who care about us helps us with managing our problems. We can seek advice from a family member, a close relative or friend and share our thoughts and feelings with them. People who care about us can raise our mood and spirits when we feel depressed or anxious.</p>
       <h5>Taking care of our health</h5>
       <p>It is vital to take care of our health. We need to ensure that our diet consists of healthy foods as well as getting regular exercises. Doing certain activities can calm us down or lift our mood. Some of these include walking, music and dancing. We should avoid using alcohol, tobacco or other drugs to cope with stress.</p>
       <h5>Being aware of our self-talk</h5>
       <p>Self-talks can worsen the stress we are currently experiencing, especially when they are mainly negative. We may say to ourselves repeatedly in our minds “I can’t handle this”, “I’m too busy”, or “I’m very tired”. Negative self-talk is never a good thing. We should focus on saying soothing and calming things instead that will reduce our stress levels. We can say to ourselves “just relax”, “calm down”.</p>
      <h5>Practicing relaxation techniques</h5>
      <p>Spend time on practicing relaxation techniques. They assist our bodies and nervous systems to settle down and readjust to our usual states. Formal relaxation techniques that we can learn include progressive muscle relaxation, meditation or yoga. Listening to certain music is suitable as a relaxation activity as well as reading a novel.</p>
      <p>Personally, I think that with the right mindset and willpower we are all capable of taking control of our lives. Now’s the time to stop and re-evaluate our daily routines, what habits must we change? How can we learn to adopt these stress management methods in our daily routines? These are some of the questions we need to answer.</p>
