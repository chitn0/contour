      <h3>LIVING THROUGH FAITH AND PRAYER</h3>
      
      <p class="subheading">Diverse beliefs, one purpose</p>

      <p><img class="flowright" alt="" src="img/_People/Kyrus/Kyrus-1a.jpg" style="width:300px;">Religion is an interesting subject matter, which is full of mystery and controversies. People say that Religion is one of the major factors that generate conflict and confusion but people today have learnt how to co-exist with one another and respect another person’s belief. If we analyze the main religions around the world such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism we will find out that they are established on similar things, and have one purpose, to pursue the path of god, or their spirit.</p>
      <p>Most people have questions like where did these religions come from, why do individuals follow a certain belief and what are the differences in these teachings. I believe that Religion and spiritual world has started long time ago through tradition, myths, stories and geographic location. From my curiosity, I started reading an article from all about religion, and found out that the origin of religion came from three basic categories, polytheistic, pantheisticand monotheistic.</p>

    <p class="subheading">Three basic categories</p>
      <h5>Polytheism</h5>
      <p>Polytheism (a belief in many gods) is said to have begun with Hinduism in around 2500 BC. This category tells us that these individuals believe in more than one god but were subject to a supreme Braham god. This category suggests that there are also other ancient cultures that follow this including Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt, Greece and Rome. It indicates that the ancient polytheistic belief systems viewed gods as being in control of all the natural occurrences such as rainfall, harvests and fertility. Polytheistic cultures believe that sacrifices would satisfy their gods.</p>
        <h5>Pantheism</h5>
        <p>Pantheism (a belief that all is god) flourished in numerous ancient cultures. The belief that the universe itself was divine was embodied in the Animism beliefs of the African and AmericanIndian cultures, the later Egyptian religion underthe Pharaohs, and Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism in the cultures of the Far East. Pantheismis the belief that god is everything, and everything is god. They believe that we must be in harmonywith everything focusing on the relationshipbetween mankind and the elements of nature.</p>
        <h5>Monotheism</h5>
        <p>Monotheism (a belief in one God) is the basis of the Judeo-christian-muslim line of religions, which started with a man called Abraham in about 2000 BC. From this, God began revealing Himself to the world across the nation of Israel. Throughout a phase of about 1500 years, God shown what became the Old Testament of the Bible, relating the history of Israel with the character and laws of God. During the Roman Empire’s era, Jesus Christ was born as the long-awaited Messiah After Jesus’ crucifixion and ascension into heaven, the Christian church flourished in His name and the New Testament was written. 600 years later, Muhammad started preaching in Mecca where he believed that he was the ultimate prophet of God, and his teachings became the principles of Islam as recorded in the teachings of the Qur’an</p>
      <p class="subheading">Why do people join religion?</p>
      <p>Almost everyone follows religion and they basically have one main purpose, for their souls to be saved. Most of us are drawn to religion not because of the fear of eternal death but there are actually a few other reasons why people incline to join a religion. These factors include tradition, ethnicity, superstitions, the need of purpose, and belief in justice, hope of afterlife and bring people together. Australia being a rich and diverse country is populated by many ethnicities, as a result there is a wide range of different religious beliefs in this country. In 2011 Census, illustrates that the dominant faith in Australia is Christianity with more than 50% devotees followed by individuals with only 22.30% who do not believe in anything.</p>

      <p class="subheading">A Christian's Story</p>
      <p><img class="flowright" alt="" src="img/_People/Kyrus/Kyrus-7.jpg" style="width:200px;">Being born in a Christian family, I began learning about God and Christianity’s principles from an early age. As an adult, I have the capacity to rethink my perspectives of the world and decide for myself if I’ll follow the doctrine I grew up with, or to choose a different doctrine to follow for myself. The world can be very influencial and sway you to doubt your faith. Despite that, I’ve chosen to keep my faith as a Christian, deciding that my sole purpose is to worship God, follow in his footsteps, and lead by example.</p>
      <p>Around four years ago, I started to fully understand what worship and faith meant to me, and I found that there was a wholesomeness in surrendering my problems and worries to God and having complete trust in him. However, there are those in the world who feel just as passionately and strongly as me for other gods and in their own religions, and it is something to be mindful of. It’s clear that there may be a handful of different religions and doctrines that come from them, but ultimately, it can be said that these all have one shared purpose of pursuing a path with faith.</p>
