      <h3>Smart Pills - Taking Drugs to Get 'High'er Grades</h3>
      <p class="subheading">With year 12 students approaching their HSC and University student preparing for their final exams, there comes a new hope of promising to unlock your brain’s full potential much like the blockbuster film Limitless.</p>
      <img alt="" src="img/_People/Leonardo/Leonardo-1.jpg">
      <p>This grey little Playstion has provided forms of entertainment and communication that was immersive and entertaining to
      me at the time, this had ultimately resulted in some negative impacts. The console was perfect to keep me entertained but at what cost? It often took up a lot of my time; it was time that I would spend outside riding the bike and running around in the backyard.</p>
      <p class="quote">"Smart Pills as known on the handball courts and campuses are a prescription drug intended to help suffers of ADHD. Medically known as Modafinil, Ritalin and Adderall, these pills come with the promise of increasing your concentration, memory, attention and intelligence, making you feel more cognitive."<span class="author"><i></i></span></p>

      <p class="subheading">The History Lesson</p>
      <p>These pills are amphetamines which were created in the year 1933 by Lazar Edeleanu and were sold under the name ‘Benzedrine’ or Benniesfor short.</p>
      <p>After in 1943 the US army was issuing ‘pep pills’ for soldiers to boost morale and fight battle fatigue. These were pure amphetamines and by the end of the World War 2 they had shipped over 150 million. The Japanese and Germans at the time were also using these pep pills and even the Fuhrer himself would get daily injectionsof amphetamines.</p>
      <p>The science behind the pills is that people with ADHD tend to have lower levels of dopamine which is a key chemical in our brains ‘reward centre’. The constant lack of dopamine leads suffers in a struggle to find constant stimulation thus making it incredibly difficult to concentrate on the task at hand. An example is having to do an assignment but constantly pushing it back to attend to every little notification from Facebook or text or even searching up in google what the net worth of Simon Cowell is. It’s not so much procrastination but rather an extremely short attention span. What amphetamines does is increase the amount of dopamine that is released in the brain and push them to brain reactors in order to stimulate the cells so that it doesn’t let minor distractions cause you to lose focus.Amphetamine’s at a molecular scope looks like this; it’s a group of carbon and 3 hydrogen atoms called a ‘methyl group’ If you add just 1 more ‘methyl group’ onto the end of amphetamine molecule it turns in to the dangerous substance methamphetamine, making it a fine line between a studious citizens to a total tweaker.</p>

      <p>Sounding too good to be true? Well like everything there are side effects such as dizziness, headaches, anxiety, nausea and nervousness. In most extreme cases it can cause motor tics, uncontrolled movements of the face, mouth, or tongue, skin rashes and heart palpitations.</p>
      <p>The difference in Modafinil, Ritalin and Adderall is down to its concentrated dosage percent. Modafinil being the lowest dosage has no addiction potential. However Ritalin being more potent and Adderall even higher in dosage, it can lead to the user becoming dependant on the drug. Many believe it being a gateway drug as they grow accustom to its effect and no longer stimulated, there’s the likelihood of abuse of more potent amphetamines or drugs.</p>
      <p>Due to the increase in popularity of ‘Smart Pills’, obtaining these legal only through prescription drug is becoming easier. With ADHD students selling from $10 - $30 a pill, which for a box containing 30 has costed them $2 a pill. Many have turned to the internet for their fix, purchasing from suppliers in India, Malaysia and Vietnam where a prescription aren’t required. However you do run the risk of not knowing where they come from, the conditions how they were made or what is even in the pills themselves. Strangely making it safer to obtain smart pills from your local ADHD student, because it’s over the counter and complies with all the Australian health standards. So with this new found illegal drug tradewhy hasn’t anyone done anything to stop it? Well to be put bluntly it’s because many of the higher ups are also taking it enhancing and maximising their potential.</p>
      <p>“When I meet people through work who run companies have many zeroes in their bank accounts, it’s uncommon that they don’t have a baggie full of supplements. They say ‘this is what I take for my brain.” Even scientists are fighting for ‘smart pills’ to become legalised and prescription free for everyone, frankly because they also use them. In an online survey conducted by Nature.com, Dave Asprey, a former Silicon Valley entrepreneur and now CEO of The Bulletproof Executive, hopes to normalize the use and states they’re already commonplace at the highest levels of business and politics.“researchers found that out of 1400+ practitioners in the field of science, 20% had admitted to abusing ‘smart pills’ for non-medical purposes.</p>
      <p>Although there are many ways to increase brain activity such as natural memory supplements, getting your 8hrs of sleep, exercising, meditating and even drinking tea or coffee. ‘Smart pills’ may seem a miracle pill that will turn you into Albert Einstein, but in fact you still have to put in the work and effort to get the work done or else you’ll have an intense google search about why the backstreet boys broke up(p.s. it’s because AJ went to rehab). Please consult your doctor before taking any drugs</p>
