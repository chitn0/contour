      <p class="quote">At the end of the day, people will take their wigs off, but you can’t stop being you. <span class="author"><i>Jenny</i></span></p>
      <p>It’s 2008, you’re walking to the venue of your first convention, and Australia’s usual 35°c is melting you—but wait. You’re saved. Because when you turn the corner, you see a live Squall Leonhart (video game character and your self-proclaimed husband). You think, “My dreams have come true,” then follow the thought with, “The heat must really be getting to me”, but it doesn’t change what you’re seeing, and It only registers with you a bit later that it had been a person wearing a wig drenched in hairspray and worrying about the fate of their makeup in the heat. That was all me. Skip a few years into the present, and I still feel giddy excitement whenever I find someone dressed as a character I love, but, unlike 13 year old me, the convention-goer of now is completely aware of the stranger in the costume (because I know the character; I’ve read their story). What I don’t know is this person who, acting on a desire to be this character, had heavily styled a wig, invested in a costume more complicated than “Sexy Nurse” and made their eyes as bright as jewels through contact lenses as large as 20-cent coins—and doing so multiple times a year.</p>
      <p>So who are these wigged strangers? Simply said, they are cosplayers, and at annual pop-culture events such as “Oz Comic Con”, “Armageddon”, “Supanova”, and “SMASH!”, they are not an uncommon sight – and that’s putting it lightly.</p>
      <p>While the presence of cosplay is more commonly dated back to American science fiction conventions in the 60s or 70s for series such as Star Trek or Star Wars, earlier acts have been reported in the 1940s in science fiction writer Mike Resnick’s book, titled “...Always a Fan” (Raymond, 2014). Nicolle Lamerichs from Maastricht University, however, notes that similar acts can be found in Western culture’s traditions of Renaissance fairs and Reenactments (2011). The term cosplaying (a portmanteau of the words ‘costume’ and ‘play’), wasn’t coined until in 1983 when game designer Takahashi Noboyuki wrote an article of the practice for a Japanese magazine (Plunkett, 2014). To an outsider, cosplay may be seen with a certain amount of cynicism as “a Halloween dress-up parade at the wrong time of the year”, as the Guardian puts it (2014), but to those involved, cosplay is an art, and if Oxford University can be believed, then this is true. Ardent cosplayers invest no small amount of money and time on materials to make their costume, and anyone in the beauty scene can attest to the wallet-drilling expenses of reliable makeup. So why do this? What do cosplayers achieve if not all of them enter the competitive side of it? Andre, a local Australian cosplayer known through their pseudonym, Knitemaya, is one example of cosplay’s ability to have one recognised (if their 55.5k following on Instagram has anything to say about it), and, through personal experience, it is their belief that cosplay can pave way to self-discovery. In one of the cosplayer’s recently-deleted Instagram posts announcing their preferred pronouns as an agender individual, Andre stated that, because they were never very feminine nor masculine in appearance, growing up was difficult for them. Cosplay, however, opened their world to learning and experimentation, and it continues to play a large part of their growth as an individual. This same experience is shared by many of those in the cosplay community, some of those whom I’ve interviewed echoing the idea that cosplay has helped solidify their sense of identity.Danny (25), a NSW cosplayer and friend to Andre told me in our interview how their experiences as a cosplayer have shaped them as a person. One part of his response was how it eliminated former insecurities of himself.</p>

      <p>“I used to be really insecure about my forehead being so big,” Danny said, “but it’s cool when I have more freedom with appearances when I adjust the height of my wigs, and it’s become such an asset for me that I don’t really care about it anymore.” In the Interview, Danny also shared how his cosplay experiences have shaped his sexual identity.</p>
      <p class="quote">I was able to be who I was in photos and at conventions without people judging me[.]<span class="author"><i>Danny</i></span></p>
      <p>“Cosplay has introduced me to a lot of people, and I’ve learnt a lot from those people. I was never open about my orientation in high school because I went to an all-boys school, (...) but when I got into the cosplay scene the year after, I started feeling more at peace with myself. While cosplaying, you feel the need to break boundaries sometimes, and when I made friends with other cosplayers who were more confident than me, I kind of took on their attitude towards things like relationships and my sexual orientation. I didn’t feel the need to hide behind this image of myself I’ve been stuck with since high school, and I was able to be who I was in photos and at conventions without people judging me for being gay.” It isn’t only Danny who feels this way. Within the cosplay community, there were also many others who voiced how cosplaying had helped them identify and be more comfortable with their own sexual orientation. When the US passed their bill for same sex marriage in June early this year, three cosplayers, Yasmin, Darryl, and Jenny, made announcements of their own queer identities. Yasmin, a NSW cosplayer who only started cosplaying in 2014, said she “had never felt that comfortable” with herself until she began meeting other people in the cosplay community. Darryl, a transgender youth, agreed with Yasmin in our group interview. “It’s hard to escape the attention and the questions, but when I cosplay, it puts me in a context that makes me more confident with who I am. I’m a ‘cosplayer’. It’s like: Yeah, I’m trans, but at the moment I’m wearing a retractable, 2-meter long, working pair of PVC angel wings that took 3 months to put together, so I think you’re missing the big picture,” Darryl said with a laugh.</p>

      <p class="quote">(...) in a cultural melting pot like Australia and within a subculture that has evolved globally, the cosplay community is diverse.<span class="author"><i>Danny</i></span></p>
      <p>“At the end of the day, people will take their wigs off, but you can’t stop being you.” said Jenny</p>
      <h5>So who are cosplayers?</h5>
      <p>Firstly, they are people like my 2008 Leon who soldiered through the heat decked out in leather and a thick fur jacket. Secondly, they are people like Jenny, Darryl, Yasmin, and Danny: people who, in the face of society’s assumptions, learn to be at peace with themselves. Put them together, and you have one interesting article of one’s own sense of identity in the world of pop-culture.</p>
